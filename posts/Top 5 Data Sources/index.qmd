  This blog post explains some of the sources that I personally prefer to obtain data. I became aware of most of these sources from Google Data Analytics Certificate program. These data sources cover a wide range of topics, including education, the labor market, child welfare, police behavior, and more. By sharing these data sources, I hope to inspire other researchers to explore new sources of data and gain fresh insights into the world around us.

## Introduction

In the world of data analysis, having access to quality data sources can make all the difference. Whether you're a researcher, a business owner, or just someone who loves playing with numbers, finding the right data can help you uncover insights and make better decisions. With so many data sources available online, it can be hard to know where to start. In this blog post, I'll be sharing my top 5 favorite data sources, each of which I've found to be reliable, user-friendly, and full of valuable information. From the Cloud Google Marketplace to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, these data sources offer a wealth of insights that I hope you'll find as useful and inspiring as I have. So without further ado, let's dive in!

## 1. [Cloud Google Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&pli=1 "Cloud Google Marketplace")

The Cloud Google Marketplace is a collection of datasets, APIs, and applications that are hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. The marketplace offers a wide range of data sources from different industries, including finance, healthcare, and transportation. Some of the popular datasets available on the Cloud Google Marketplace include:

-   COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)

-   New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Data

-   Chicago Crime Data

-   OpenFDA Drug Label API

-   US Census Bureau Data

The platform offers an intuitive interface that allows users to search for datasets, preview data, and access documentation. The marketplace also provides access to cloud-based tools for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.

## 2. [Drought.gov](https://www.drought.gov/data-maps-tools "Drought.gov data maps tools")

Drought.gov is a comprehensive resource for drought-related data, maps, and tools in the United States. The website provides a variety of data sources, including:

-   Drought Monitor

-   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data

-   Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI)

-   U.S. Drought Atlas

The website offers easy access to a wide range of data, including both historical and real-time data. Additionally, the site provides a number of interactive maps and visualizations that make it easy to explore the data and gain insights.

## 3. [UNICEF Statistical Tables](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/sowc-2019-statistical-tables/ "UNICEF Statistical Tables")

UNICEF Statistical Tables is a data source that provides a wide range of data on child welfare and development across the globe. The data is collected from various sources, including national surveys and administrative records. Some of the data available on the UNICEF Statistical Tables includes:

-   Child mortality rates

-   Nutrition indicators

-   Education indicators

-   Child protection indicators

The platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse data by country, indicator, or year. For instance, policymakers looking to design effective policies to improve child welfare in their countries could use data from UNICEF Statistical Tables to identify areas where interventions are most needed, such as high child mortality rates or low school enrollment rates.

## 4. [OpenPolicing.Stanford.edu](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/ "Stanford's data bank")

OpenPolicing.Stanford.edu is a data source that provides access to millions of records of police stops and searches across the United States. The data is collected from various law enforcement agencies and compiled into a standardized format for analysis. The platform also provides tools for exploring the data, including interactive maps and dashboards. As this source of data contains pretty complicate information, you should definitely check the [Read Me File](before%20you%20delve%20into%20this%20data, "git-hub link") before you delve into it.

The platform provides detailed data on police stops and searches, including the race and ethnicity of the individuals involved, the reason for the stop, and the outcome of the encounter.

One example of how this data could be used is to identify patterns of racial bias in policing. By analyzing the data on police stops and searches, researchers can identify whether certain racial or ethnic groups are more likely to be stopped or searched than others, and whether these disparities are driven by legitimate factors (such as crime rates) or by bias.

## 5. [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Tables](https://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm "BLS Tables")

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Tables is a data source that provides access to a wide range of data on the U.S. labor market. The platform offers a wealth of data, including:

-   Unemployment rates

-   Employment by industry and occupation

-   Labor force participation rates

-   Average wages and salaries

-   Job openings and hires

The platform provides a variety of tools for data exploration and analysis, including charts, tables, and interactive visualizations. For example, if you're a policymaker looking to design policies that promote job growth and reduce unemployment, you could use BLS Tables data to identify which industries are experiencing job growth, which occupations are in high demand, and which regions have the highest unemployment rates.

## An Easter Egg: [OpenPsychometrics.org](https://openpsychometrics.org/ "Open Psychometrics")

As a surprise addition to my list of favorite data sources, I would like to introduce OpenPsychometrics.org. I came across with this website during a Ph.D. course on Item Response Theory carried by Associate Professor Ergül Demir. This website provides access to a collection of free psychological tests and assessments, which can be used for a wide range of purposes, from self-reflection to academic research.

Some of the psychological tests available on the site include:

-   The Big Five personality traits

-   Emotional intelligence

-   Cognitive abilities

-   Moral reasoning

As someone who is interested in both data science and psychology, I have found OpenPsychometrics.org to be an incredibly interesting and valuable resource. The website offers a wide range of psychological tests that can help individuals gain insights into their own personality traits, cognitive abilities, and emotional intelligence. Additionally, researchers can use the site to conduct studies on these topics and collect data for analysis.

In conclusion, OpenPsychometrics.org is a valuable resource for anyone interested in psychology, personal development, or academic research. The platform offers a variety of free psychological tests that can help individuals gain insights into themselves, as well as collect data for research purposes.

## Conclusion

These are just a few of my favorite data sources that have proven to be invaluable for my work as a researcher. Each of these data sources provides a unique perspective on different aspects of the world, from labor markets to child welfare to police behavior. By combining and analyzing data from these sources, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world around us and make better-informed decisions.
