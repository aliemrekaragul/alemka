Hey there!

You are visiting my personal blog, so here is a little bit of information about me:

I am passionate about learning and exploring new ideas in the fields of Data Science, Psychometrics, Data Analytics, and Educational Assessment. I have a deep interest in language assessment and have conducted research in this field. My research focuses on understanding the impact of different assessment techniques on student outcomes. I am a driven individual who believes in hard work and dedication and I am always looking for new opportunities to make a positive impact. I am an avid reader and always looking to learn something new.

Currently, I work on my PhD in Educational Assessment and Evaluation. My current research interest is on Automated Essay Scoring, which has led me through machine learning and natural language processing.
