# Welcome to Alemka Notebook Repository

This repository hosts the source code and related files for an educational data science blog: [emrekaragul.com](https://emrekaragul.com/). The blog focuses on topics such as data science, psychometrics, educational assessment, and various tools and insights from these fields. Main focus is on using `R` and `Python` for data analysis and visualization.

## Structure
- **`/posts`**: Contains the Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files for the blog.
- **`/_freeze`**: Includes frozen html files for the blog. That's crucial as some of the blog posts are computationally intensive and may take a long time to render. 
- **`/docs`**: Is actually the root directory for the blog. It includes the main page, blog posts, and other related files in html format.
- **`/_extentions`**: Is used to store custom extensions for Quarto such as Socail Share bar or Web-R extensions.

## Setup Instructions
To modify the blog locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/aliemrekaragul/alemka.git```

2. Make your suggestions on any file in the root or `/posts` directories (changes other files would be redundant). 

3. Start the local server:
   ```quarto render```
   If you are using R studio, you can also use the RStudio Addin to render the files.
